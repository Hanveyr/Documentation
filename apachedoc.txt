""""
Apache, to serve the default page when a directory is accessed. If you name your file "index.html," Apache will automatically display it when you visit your site's URL (e.g., http://localhost/mywebsite).

However, you can use a different file name if you prefer. If you do, you'll need to specify the file name in the URL. For example, if you name your file "homepage.html," you would access it by navigating to http://localhost/mywebsite/homepage.html.
