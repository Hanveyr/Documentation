-Nginx- (pronounced "Engine-X")

Open-source web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache


Install nginx:
sudo apt install nginx

Adjust Firewall:
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
sudo ufw status

Verify:
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

Find all host names:
hostname -I
192.169.1.142 192.169.0.142 110.69.420.64 fd4a:234c:a1e2::b304:d564

Open a Web Browser:
Enter your server's IP address in the address bar, http://your_server_ip







-Server Blocks-
Server blocks in Nginx allow you to host multiple websites on a single server.
Each server block directs incoming traffic to the correct site based on the
domain name requested.


multiple websites:
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/mywebsite.com/html
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/anotherwebsite.com/html


Server Block Configuration Files:
/etc/nginx/sites-available/


Create website.com file for Each page:
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/mywebsite.com

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mywebsite.com www.mywebsite.com;

    root /var/www/mywebsite.com/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}

















Step 5: Enable the Server Blocks

Create symlinks from the configuration files in sites-available to the sites-enabled directory:

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mywebsite.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/anotherwebsite.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/



Step 6: Test Your Configuration

Test the Nginx configuration for syntax errors:

sudo nginx -t

sudo systemctl reload nginx


Step 7: Update DNS Settings

Ensure that your domain names (mywebsite.com and anotherwebsite.com) point to your server's IP address. This step is typically done through your domain registrar's DNS management interface.
Step 8: Access Your Sites

Open your web browser and navigate to http://mywebsite.com and http://anotherwebsite.com. You should see the respective welcome messages for each site.

This setup allows you to host multiple websites on a single server using Nginx server blocks. Each server block configuration file directs traffic based on the domain name, ensuring that the correct website is served.
