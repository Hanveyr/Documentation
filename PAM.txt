1. Introduction to PAM

What is PAM?

PAM, or Pluggable Authentication Modules, is a flexible mechanism for authenticating users. It allows system administrators to configure authentication policies without modifying application code.
Importance of PAM in Linux

PAM is crucial for managing authentication processes, ensuring security, and providing a modular approach to handle authentication tasks across various applications and services on a Linux system.






2. PAM Architecture
Components of PAM

PAM consists of four main components:

    PAM Library: Provides the core functionalities and interfaces for PAM.
    PAM Modules: Individual shared libraries that implement specific authentication tasks.
    PAM Configuration Files: Define the authentication policies and which modules to use.
    Applications: Utilize PAM to authenticate users.

PAM Modules and Configuration Files

PAM modules are stored in /lib/security/ or /usr/lib/security/, and configuration files are located in /etc/pam.d/.




3. Basic Configuration of PAM
Installing PAM

PAM is typically installed by default on most Linux distributions. To ensure it's installed, you can use the package manager:


# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev

# For RHEL/CentOS
sudo yum install pam-devel

Understanding the pam.d Directory

The /etc/pam.d/ directory contains configuration files for each service that uses PAM. Each file specifies the modules and their order of execution for that service.
Configuring PAM Modules

A typical PAM configuration file consists of lines with the following format:
Code

<module_type> <control_flag> <module_path> <module_options>

    module_type: Specifies the type of PAM function (auth, account, password, session).
    control_flag: Determines the behavior if the module succeeds or fails (required, requisite, sufficient, optional).
    module_path: Path to the PAM module.
    module_options: Optional parameters passed to the module.






4. Common PAM Modules and Their Usage
pam_unix.so

Handles standard Unix authentication.

auth required pam_unix.so

pam_tally2.so

Counts login attempts and can lock accounts after a certain number of failures.


auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5 unlock_time=600
account required pam_tally2.so

pam_limits.so

Sets resource limits for user sessions.

session required pam_limits.so

pam_env.so

Sets environment variables.

auth required pam_env.so

------PAM's Stack-Based Authentication Process-------
Overview

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) uses a stack-based architecture to manage authentication processes. Each service that requires authentication has its own PAM configuration file, typically located in /etc/pam.d/. These configuration files contain a stack of PAM modules that are executed in sequence.
Example Configuration

Let's look at an example PAM configuration file for the sshd service:
plaintext

# /etc/pam.d/sshd

auth       required     pam_sepermit.so
auth       include      password-auth
account    required     pam_nologin.so
account    include      password-auth
password   include      password-auth
session    required     pam_selinux.so close
session    required     pam_loginuid.so
session    optional     pam_keyinit.so force revoke
session    include      password-auth
session    required     pam_selinux.so open

Explanation

    auth: This module is responsible for authenticating the user. It can prompt for passwords, check tokens, etc.
    account: This module verifies that the access is allowed for the user. It can check if the account is locked or expired.
    password: This module is used for changing user passwords.
    session: This module manages the setup and teardown of sessions.





Each line in the configuration file specifies a module type (auth, account, password, session), a control flag (required, requisite, sufficient, optional), and the name of the module to be executed.
2. Module Precedence Rules
Overview

The order in which modules are listed in a PAM configuration file is crucial. Each module is executed in sequence, and the control flags determine the flow of execution based on the module's success or failure.
Control Flags

    required: The module must succeed for the overall result to be successful. If it fails, the user is not immediately rejected, but the failure is recorded.
    requisite: The module must succeed for the overall result to be successful. If it fails, the user is immediately rejected.
    sufficient: If the module succeeds, PAM returns success immediately and ignores the rest of the stack. If it fails, the result is ignored, and the next module is executed.
    optional: The module's success or failure does not affect the overall result.




Example
plaintext

# /etc/pam.d/example

auth       required     pam_unix.so
auth       requisite    pam_succeed_if.so user ingroup admin
auth       sufficient   pam_ldap.so use_first_pass
auth       optional     pam_permit.so

Explanation

    pam_unix.so (required): This module must succeed for authentication to succeed.
    pam_succeed_if.so (requisite): If the user is not in the admin group, authentication fails immediately.
    pam_ldap.so (sufficient): If this module succeeds using the previously entered password (use_first_pass), authentication succeeds immediately.
    pam_permit.so (optional): This module's result does not affect the overall authentication result.












3. Understanding Control Flags Thoroughly
Detailed Explanation

    required: Ensures that the module must be successful for the entire stack to succeed. However, the result is not immediately returned; instead, the process continues to the next module.
    requisite: Similar to required, but if this module fails, the authentication process stops immediately, and the failure is returned.
    sufficient: If this module succeeds, the authentication process stops immediately, and success is returned. If it fails, the process continues without affecting the overall result.
    optional: The success or failure of this module does not affect the overall result unless no other required, requisite, or sufficient modules are present.

Practical Example

To illustrate the control flags, let's consider a scenario where we need to authenticate a user, ensuring they are part of a specific group and allowing LDAP authentication as a fallback:
plaintext

# /etc/pam.d/custom-auth

auth       required     pam_unix.so
auth       requisite    pam_succeed_if.so user ingroup admin
auth       sufficient   pam_ldap.so use_first_pass
auth       optional     pam_permit.so

Explanation

    pam_unix.so (required): The system first checks the local Unix authentication. If this fails, the process continues, but the failure is recorded.
    pam_succeed_if.so (requisite): Ensures the user is part of the admin group. If not, authentication stops immediately.
    pam_ldap.so (sufficient): Attempts LDAP authentication using the first password entered. If successful, authentication succeeds immediately.
    pam_permit.so (optional): This module's result is ignored, but it can be used to grant access in certain conditions without affecting the overall result.

Conclusion

By understanding PAM's stack-based authentication process, module precedence rules, and control flags, you can create robust and secure authentication mechanisms. This part of the guide provides the foundation for mastering PAM configurations and ensuring that your authentication processes are both secure and efficient.
