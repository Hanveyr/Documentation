Basic IPv4 Structure


IPv4 Format:

Purpose: 32-bit address divided into four octets
Structure: x.x.x.x where x is 0-255
Example: 192.168.1.1
Binary: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001


Octet Breakdown:

First Octet (192):

Binary: 11000000
Range: 0-255
Position: Network portion


Second Octet (168):

Binary: 10101000
Range: 0-255
Position: Network portion


Third Octet (1):

Binary: 00000001
Range: 0-255
Position: Host portion


Fourth Octet (1):

Binary: 00000001
Range: 0-255
Position: Host portion




Binary Position Values: 128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1
Examples:

192 = 128 + 64 = 11000000
168 = 128 + 32 + 8 = 10101000
1 = 1 = 00000001




Address Classes


Class A:

First bit: 0
Range: 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
Default mask: 255.0.0.0 (/8)
Format: Network.Host.Host.Host
Example: 10.0.0.1


Class B:

First bits: 10
Range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
Default mask: 255.255.0.0 (/16)
Format: Network.Network.Host.Host
Example: 172.16.0.1


Class C:

First bits: 110
Range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
Default mask: 255.255.255.0 (/24)
Format: Network.Network.Network.Host
Example: 192.168.1.1


Class D (Multicast):

First bits: 1110
Range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
Purpose: Multicast traffic
Example: 224.0.0.1 (All hosts multicast)


Class E (Reserved):

First bits: 1111
Range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
Purpose: Experimental use
Example: 240.0.0.1


Real-world example: A corporate network uses Class A (10.0.0.0/8) for its internal addressing, Class B (172.16.0.0/12) for branch offices, and Class C (192.168.1.0/24) for individual departments.


Subnet Masks


Purpose: Define network and host portions
Format: Continuous 1s followed by 0s
Common Masks:

255.0.0.0 (/8):

Binary: 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
Use: Class A networks
Hosts: 16,777,214


255.255.0.0 (/16):

Binary: 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000
Use: Class B networks
Hosts: 65,534


255.255.255.0 (/24):

Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Use: Class C networks
Hosts: 254




CIDR Notation:

/8 = 255.0.0.0
/16 = 255.255.0.0
/24 = 255.255.255.0
/28 = 255.255.255.240

Network Calculations


Network Address: IP AND Mask

Example: 192.168.1.1/24 = 192.168.1.0


Broadcast Address: Network OR Wildcard

Example: 192.168.1.0/24 = 192.168.1.255


Available Hosts: 2^(32-prefix) - 2

Example: /24 = 2^8 - 2 = 254 hosts


First Usable: Network address + 1

Example: 192.168.1.0/24 = 192.168.1.1


Last Usable: Broadcast address - 1

Example: 192.168.1.255/24 = 192.168.1.254


Number of Subnets: 2^(new bits)

Example: /24 to /28 = 2^4 = 16 subnets




Common Subnets


/24 Network:

Mask: 255.255.255.0
Hosts: 254


Subnets of /24:

/25: 2 subnets, 126 hosts each
/26: 4 subnets, 62 hosts each
/27: 8 subnets, 30 hosts each
/28: 16 subnets, 14 hosts each
/29: 32 subnets, 6 hosts each
/30: 64 subnets, 2 hosts each


Subnet Sizes:

/24: 256 addresses
/25: 128 addresses
/26: 64 addresses
/27: 32 addresses
/28: 16 addresses
/29: 8 addresses

Address Planning


Best Practices:

Plan for growth
Use appropriate size subnets
Document allocations
Leave room for expansion


Planning Steps:

Count required hosts
Add 30% growth factor
Choose appropriate mask
Document assignments


Example Plan:

Department A: 100 hosts

Subnet: /25 (126 hosts)
Range: 192.168.1.0/25


Department B: 50 hosts

Subnet: /26 (62 hosts)
Range: 192.168.1.128/26






Common Errors and Troubleshooting


Overlapping Subnets:

Problem: Subnets share addresses
Solution: Check subnet boundaries
Example: 192.168.1.0/24 overlaps 192.168.1.128/25


Mask Mismatch:

Problem: Different masks on same network
Solution: Standardize subnet masks
Example: 255.255.255.0 vs 255.255.255.128


Address Exhaustion:

Problem: No available addresses
Solution: Use smaller subnets or consolidate
Example: Split /24 into /25s


Duplicate IP Addresses:

Problem: Two devices using same IP
Solution: Reassign unique IP to one device
Example: 192.168.1.10 used by two PCs


Incorrect Subnet Mask:

Problem: Wrong mask prevents communication
Solution: Correct subnet mask on device
Example: /24 used instead of /26


Troubleshooting Tips:

Verify physical connectivity
Confirm IP address and mask
Check default gateway
Test with ping and traceroute
Review switch/router configurations




Practical Examples


Example 1: Subnetting a Class C

Given network: 192.168.1.0/24
Requirement: 4 subnets with 50 hosts each
Solution:
a. 50 hosts require /26 subnet (62 hosts)
b. Subnets created:

192.168.1.0/26
192.168.1.64/26
192.168.1.128/26
192.168.1.192/26




Example 2: VLSM Network Design

Given:

172.16.0.0/16 network
4 facilities with 500, 250, 120, 50 users


Solution:
a. Facility 1 (500): 172.16.0.0/23 (510 hosts)
b. Facility 2 (250): 172.16.2.0/24 (254 hosts)
c. Facility 3 (120): 172.16.3.0/25 (126 hosts)
