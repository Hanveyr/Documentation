1. Introduction to Linux Services and Daemons

Defining Services and Daemons

A service is a background process that runs continuously, providing specific system or network functionality. Services typically:

    Run in the background
    Start at system boot
    Provide ongoing system functionality
    Operate without direct user interaction

Common Examples of Services and Daemons

    sshd (Secure Shell Daemon)


Purpose: Provides secure remote access
Location: /usr/sbin/sshd
Typical configuration: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl status sshd

httpd/Apache Web Server


Purpose: Hosts web services and serves web content
Location: /usr/sbin/httpd or /usr/bin/apache2
Typical configuration: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
systemctl status httpd

crond (Cron Daemon)

Purpose: Executes scheduled tasks and jobs
Location: /usr/sbin/crond
Configuration: /etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/
systemctl status crond


NetworkManager
    Purpose: Manages network connections and interfaces
    Location: /usr/sbin/NetworkManager
    systemctl status NetworkManager




2. History and Evolution of Service Management
Traditional Init System (SysV)
    Sequential startup process
    Slow boot times
    Complex dependency management
    Limited parallelization

Transition to systemd
    Developed by Lennart Poettering and Kay Sievers
    First released in 2010
    Adopted by major distributions (Fedora, Ubuntu, CentOS)

Key Advantages of systemd
    Parallel service startup
    On-demand service activation
    Unified logging system (journald)
    Improved dependency management
    Faster boot times
    Centralized system and service control




3. Understanding systemd Architecture
Core Components
    systemd (PID 1)
    systemctl (Management tool)
    journald (Logging system)
    networkd (Network configuration)
    resolved (DNS resolution)
