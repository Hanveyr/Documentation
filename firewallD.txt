|      Packet Flow                   |
+--------------------------------------+






FirewallD operates at the user-space level, acting as a controller and interface for configuring the
kernel-space Netfilter hooks. Here's a breakdown of the components:

    FirewallD: The FirewallD daemon runs in user-space and provides the management interface for
    configuring firewall rules and policies. Administrators interact with FirewallD through its command
    line client firewall-cmd, configuration files, or D-Bus API.
    Netfilter: Netfilter is a framework inside the Linux kernel that enables packet filtering, network
    address translation (NAT), and other packet mangling. It provides a set of hooks at various points
    in the network stack where packet inspection and manipulation can occur.
    Conntrack: Connection tracking (conntrack) is a Netfilter module that keeps track of the state of
    network connections and sessions traveling through the system. It enables stateful inspection of
    packets, allowing the firewall to make decisions based on the connection context.






When a packet enters the Linux network stack:

    The packet first hits the Netfilter hooks in the kernel-space.
    Conntrack examines the packet and associates it with a new or existing connection in its state
    table.
    The packet then passes through the various Netfilter hooks where it is inspected against the rules
    defined by FirewallD.
    Based on these rules, the packet is accepted, dropped, rejected, or manipulated.
    If accepted, the packet continues to its intended destination.








FirewallD's primary role is to provide a user-friendly abstraction over these kernel-space components.
It allows defining rules and policies in a higher-level language which are then translated to the
underlying Netfilter rules.





















Firewalld is a dynamic firewall management tool that supports different firewall zones. Each zone has a predefined set of rules that dictate the trust level of network connections. Here is a detailed explanation of each zone:

1. Trusted Zone

    Description: This zone is the least restrictive. It allows all incoming traffic without any filtering.
    Use Case: Use this zone for networks that you fully trust, such as a home network where you control all the devices.
    Rules: All incoming traffic is accepted.

2. Home Zone

    Description: This zone is designed for home use. It rejects incoming traffic unless it is related to outgoing traffic or matches specific types of traffic.
    Use Case: Ideal for home networks where you want some level of security but still allow common services and related traffic.
    Rules:
        Rejects all incoming traffic by default.
        Allows incoming traffic that is related to outgoing traffic (stateful inspection).
        Allows specific types of traffic such as DHCP, mDNS, etc.

3. Internal Zone

    Description: This zone is used for internal networks. It provides a higher level of trust than the public zone but is more restrictive than the home zone.
    Use Case: Suitable for internal networks within an organization where you want to allow more services but still limit exposure.
    Rules:
        Rejects all incoming traffic by default.
        Allows specific services and types of traffic that are typically used within an internal network.

4. Work Zone

    Description: This zone is intended for use in work environments. It is similar to the internal zone but may have different rules based on organizational policies.
    Use Case: Use this zone for work networks where you need to allow certain services and maintain a balance between security and functionality.
    Rules:
        Rejects all incoming traffic by default.
        Allows specific services and types of traffic typically used in a work environment.

5. Public Zone

    Description: This zone is used for public networks, such as those found in coffee shops or airports. It provides a higher level of security by limiting incoming traffic.
    Use Case: Ideal for use in public Wi-Fi hotspots where you want to protect your device from potential threats.
    Rules:
        Rejects all incoming traffic by default.
        Allows specific types of traffic that are deemed safe for public networks.

6. External Zone

    Description: This zone is intended for use with external networks, such as the internet. It is highly restrictive to protect your device from external threats.
    Use Case: Use this zone for connections to the internet or other untrusted external networks.
    Rules:
        Rejects all incoming traffic by default.
        Allows specific types of traffic that are explicitly permitted.

7. DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

    Description: This zone is used for servers that need to be accessible from external networks but still require some level of protection.
    Use Case: Suitable for web servers, mail servers, and other public-facing services that need to be accessible from the internet.
    Rules:
        Rejects all incoming traffic by default.
        Allows specific services and types of traffic required for the public-facing services.

8. Block Zone

    Description: This zone is the most restrictive. It blocks all incoming and outgoing connections.
    Use Case: Use this zone to block all network traffic when you want to completely isolate a device from the network.
    Rules:
        Blocks all incoming and outgoing traffic.

9. Drop Zone

    Description: This zone drops all incoming connections without sending any response packets.
    Use Case: Use this zone when you want to silently drop all incoming traffic without informing the sender.
    Rules:
        Drops all incoming traffic.
        No response packets are sent (e.g., no ICMP unreachable messages).

2.2. FirewallD Services

FirewallD operates as a suite of interrelated services and components:

    firewalld.service: The main FirewallD service responsible for loading and enforcing firewall rules.
    firewalld: The FirewallD server daemon that runs in the background and listens for configuration changes.
    firewall-cmd: The primary command-line client used to interact with and configure FirewallD.
    firewall-config: A graphical user interface for FirewallD configuration, though most server environments rely on the command-line tool.
    firewall-offline-cmd: A command-line client used to build and inspect persistent firewall configurations when FirewallD isn’t running.
    firewalld.conf: The main FirewallD configuration file located at /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf.
    Configuration files: XML files located in /usr/lib/firewalld/ and /etc/firewalld/ that define zones, services, and other firewall configurations.






These components work together to provide the FirewallD functionality. The daemon listens for configuration changes from the clients, which it then applies to its internal configurations and the kernel-space firewalling components.
2.3. FirewallD Configuration Files

FirewallD uses a set of XML configuration files to define zones, services, ICMP types, and other firewall settings. These files are located in two directories:

    /usr/lib/firewalld/: This directory contains the default configuration files shipped with FirewallD. These should not be edited directly as updates to FirewallD can overwrite changes.
    /etc/firewalld/: This directory contains user-created or customized configuration files. Files here override the defaults in /usr/lib/firewalld/.








Key configuration files include:

    zones/: This directory contains XML files defining the different network zones. Each file describes the services, ports, protocols, and other settings allowed in the zone.
    services/: This directory contains XML files defining different network services. Each file lists the ports, protocols, and other settings associated with the service.
    icmptypes/: This directory contains XML files defining various ICMP types used in firewall rules.
    firewalld.conf: This is the main configuration file for FirewallD. It sets global settings like the default zone, minimal mark, and cleanup on exit options.







Here’s an example of a service definition XML file (/usr/lib/firewalld/services/http.xml):
XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<service>
  <short>WWW (HTTP)</short>
  <description>HTTP is the protocol used to serve Web pages.</description>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="80"/>
</service>

This file defines the "http" service as using TCP on port 80.








Administrators can create their own service and zone definitions by placing XML files in the corresponding directories under /etc/firewalld/. This allows for customization without altering the default configurations.
3. Installation and Configuration
3.1. Installing FirewallD

FirewallD comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Fedora. If it’s not installed, you can install it using your distribution’s package manager.







On Red Hat-based distributions:
bash

sudo yum install firewalld

On Debian and Ubuntu:
bash

sudo apt install firewalld

After installation, you need to start the FirewallD service and optionally enable it to start on boot.

Starting FirewallD:
bash

sudo systemctl start firewalld

Enabling FirewallD to start on boot:
bash

sudo systemctl enable firewalld





3.2. Configuring FirewallD

FirewallD can be configured using the command-line tool firewall-cmd, by editing configuration files, or through GUI tools like firewall-config.

The firewall-cmd command is the primary method for interacting with FirewallD. It allows you to view the current configuration, change settings, add or remove rules, and manage zones and services.








Here are a few common firewall-cmd commands:

    View the default zone:

bash

firewall-cmd --get-default-zone

    View the active zones:

bash

firewall-cmd --get-active-zones

    Add a service to the default zone:

bash

sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http

    Add a port to the default zone:

bash

sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp

    Reload the firewall to apply changes:

bash

sudo firewall-cmd --reload

    Make a rule permanent (persist across reboots):

bash

sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent

These are just a few examples. The firewall-cmd tool provides a wide range of options for configuring and managing FirewallD.







3.3. Checking FirewallD Status

You can check the status of FirewallD and view the current configuration using several firewall-cmd commands.

    Check if FirewallD is running:

bash

sudo firewall-cmd --state

    View the current FirewallD configuration:

bash

sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

This command displays the default zone, active zones, services, ports, and other FirewallD settings.

You can also use systemd commands to check the status of the FirewallD service:
bash

sudo systemctl status firewalld

This command shows whether the FirewallD service is active, the process ID, and any recent log entries.

FirewallD comes with a set of predefined services that can be easily added to zones. These services are defined in XML files located in /usr/lib/firewalld/services/.
7.2. Custom Services

If you need to define a custom service, you can create an XML file in /etc/firewalld/services/. Here’s an example of defining a custom service for a hypothetical application:
XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<service>
  <short>My Custom App</short>
  <description>My custom application service</description>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="12345"/>
  <port protocol="udp" port="12345"/>
</service>

Save this file as /etc/firewalld/services/my_custom_app.xml. You can then add this service to a zone:
bash

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=my_custom_app
sudo firewall-cmd --reload





7.3. Port Configuration

    Temporarily open a port:

bash

firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp

    Permanently open multiple ports:

bash

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --add-port=9090/udp
firewall-cmd --reload

    Remove a previously opened port:

bash

firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=8080/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload






8. Rich Rules
8.1. Rich Rule Syntax

Rich rules use a specific syntax to define complex rules. Here’s a basic structure:
bash

rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.1.1" port port="12345" protocol="tcp" accept





8.2. Creating Rich Rules

    Block specific IP address:

bash

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.1.100" drop'

    Allow specific service from a trusted IP address:

bash

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.1.100" service name="ssh" accept'





8.3. Advanced Traffic Control

    Limit SSH connection rate:

bash

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" service name="ssh" limit value="10/minute" accept'



8.4. Example Rich Rules

Provide examples of complex rich rules here.


9. Direct Rules
9.1. Direct Rule Syntax

Direct rules use the iptables syntax directly within FirewallD.

9.2. Creating Direct Rules

Add a direct rule:
bash

firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --reload



10. Integration with NFTables
10.1. How FirewallD Uses NFTables



FirewallD can translate its rules to NFTables rules, providing a seamless transition from iptables.
10.2. Translating iptables Rules

13.2. FirewallD D-Bus API Example
Here's an example of using the FirewallD D-Bus API to add a service to the default zone:




import dbus

bus = dbus.SystemBus()
firewalld = bus.get_object('org.fedoraproject.FirewallD1', '/org/fedoraproject/FirewallD1')
firewalld_iface = dbus.Interface(firewalld, dbus_interface='org.fedoraproject.FirewallD1')

# Add service to default zone
firewalld_iface.addService('', 'http', 0)




.3. Python FirewallD Bindings Example
This example demonstrates how to use the Python firewall bindings to create a new zone and add a source port:


from firewall.client import FirewallClient

# Create FirewallClient instance
fw = FirewallClient()

# Create new zone
fw.config().addZone("custom-zone", "My Custom Zone", default=False)

# Add source port to zone
fw.config().zone("custom-zone").addSource("192.168.1.0/24")

# Reload FirewallD
fw.reload()







 Ansible Firewall Modules Example
Here's an Ansible playbook snippet that uses the firewalld module to ensure SSH is enabled and port 8080 is open:
- name: Firewall configuration
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure SSH is enabled
      firewalld:
        service: ssh
        permanent: yes
        state: enabled

    - name: Open port 8080
      firewalld:
        port: 8080/tcp
        permanent: yes
        state: enabled

What Does Masking a Service Mean?

When a service is masked, its service file is replaced with a symbolic link to /dev/null. This effectively makes the service unavailable for starting because systemd cannot find the actual service file.
Why Mask a Service?

    Prevent Conflicts: If two services are known to conflict with each other, you can mask one of them to ensure that it does not start and cause issues.
    Security: Masking a service can prevent it from being started by accident, which can be important for services that should not run for security reasons.
    Stability: Some services might cause instability on your system. Masking them ensures they cannot be started, which can help maintain system stability.

How to Mask and Unmask a Service
Mask a Service

To mask a service, you use the systemctl mask command:
bash

# Mask the service
sudo systemctl mask <service-name>

For example, to mask the httpd service:
bash

sudo systemctl mask httpd

This creates a symbolic link from the service file to /dev/null, effectively disabling it.
Unmask a Service

To unmask a service, you use the systemctl unmask command:
bash

# Unmask the service
sudo systemctl unmask <service-name>

For example, to unmask the httpd service:
bash

sudo systemctl unmask httpd

This removes the symbolic link to /dev/null, allowing the service to be started again.
Example Scenario

Imagine you have two services, httpd (Apache) and nginx, and you want to ensure that only one of them runs at a time to avoid port conflicts. You could mask the httpd service to ensure that only nginx runs:
bash

sudo systemctl mask httpd
sudo systemctl start nginx

Checking Service Status

You can check the status of a service to see if it is masked:
bash

systemctl status <service-name>

For example:
bash

systemctl status httpd

If the service is masked, the output will indicate that it is linked to /dev/null.
Conclusion

Masking a service in systemd is a powerful way to ensure that certain services do not run, either to prevent conflicts, enhance security, or maintain system stability. By using the mask and unmask commands, you can control the availability of services on your system.










16. Conclusion

FirewallD provides a powerful, flexible approach to Linux network security management, offering administrators comprehensive tools for protecting network infrastructure. By leveraging its zone-based configuration and rich rule capabilities, FirewallD simplifies the process of defining and managing firewall policies.
