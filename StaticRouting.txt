1. Introduction to IP Routing
Importance-

IP routing is essential for directing network traffic from its source to its destination across various network nodes. Proper IP routing ensures efficient data transfer, reliable communication, and optimized network performance.
Overview of Static and Dynamic Routing

    Static Routing: Manually configured routes that remain constant. Ideal for small networks with predictable traffic patterns.
    Dynamic Routing: Uses routing protocols to automatically adjust routes. Suitable for large networks with changing topologies.




2. Static Routing with Netplan

Introduction to Netplan

Netplan is a YAML-based network configuration tool introduced in Ubuntu 18.04. It simplifies network management by using declarative configurations.
Configuring Static Routes with Netplan

Step-by-Step Guide:
    Open the Netplan Configuration File:
    bash
sudo vi /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml

Add Static Route Configuration:
YAML

network:
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      dhcp4: false
      addresses: [192.168.1.202/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, 192.168.1.1]
      routes:
        - to: 172.16.0.0/24
          via: 192.168.1.100
  version: 2


Apply the Configuration:
bash

sudo netplan apply

Verify the Configuration:
    ip route s







3. Static Routing with ip Command

Adding Temporary Static Routes

Use the ip command to add non-persistent routes.

Example:
sudo ip route add 10.10.10.0/24 via 192.168.1.254





Adding Persistent Static Routes

To make routes persistent, add them to the Netplan configuration file or use a script that runs at boot.

Example Script:
# /etc/network/if-up.d/add-static-routes
#!/bin/sh
ip route add 10.10.10.0/24 via 192.168.1.254

Make the script executable:
sudo chmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/add-static-routes




4. Practical Hands-on Scenarios
Example: Adding a Static Route to Access a Different Subnet

Scenario:
Your main network is 10.0.0.0/8 with a default gateway at 10.0.0.1. You have a secondary network 172.16.5.0/24 accessible via a router at 10.0.0.101.

Configuration:
sudo ip route add 172.16.5.0/24 via 10.0.0.101 dev eth0



Example: Configuring Static Routing for a Multi-Homed System

Scenario:
Configure a system with two network interfaces connected to different networks.

Configuration:
YAML

network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: yes
    eth1:
      addresses: [192.168.2.10/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.2.1

-------Comprehensive Static IP Routing Examples-----


1. Configuring Redundant Static Routes

Scenario: Set up redundant static routes to the destination 172.16.0.0/24 via two different gateways, 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2. Test failover.

# Configure primary route
ip route add 172.16.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.1
 # Configure backup route with higher metric
ip route add 172.16.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.2 metric 10
 # Test failover by disabling primary route
ip route del 172.16.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.1



2. Implementing Policy-Based Routing
Scenario: Route HTTP traffic (port 80) from 192.168.1.0/24 through gateway 10.0.0.1, and all other traffic through 10.0.0.2.
# Create routing tables
echo "1 http" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
echo "2 other" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
 # Configure routes in tables
ip route add default via 10.0.0.1 table http
ip route add default via 10.0.0.2 table other
 # Define policy rules
ip rule add from 192.168.1.0/24 fwmark 1 table http
ip rule add from 192.168.1.0/24 table other
 # Mark HTTP traffic with iptables
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j MARK --set-mark 1



3. Troubleshooting Asymmetric Routing
Example: Identify and fix asymmetric routing issue.
# Detect asymmetric routing
traceroute -n 8.8.8.8
# Output shows different paths for outbound and return traffic
 # Implement source-based routing
ip route add default via 10.0.0.1 src 192.168.1.100




4. IPv6 Static Routing
Configuration example:
network:
version: 2
ethernets:
eth0:
addresses:
- 2001:db8:1::100/64
routes:
- to: 2001:db8:2::/64
via: 2001:db8:1::1




5. Configuring VRF
Step-by-step example:
# Create VRF
ip link add vrf-blue type vrf table 10ip link set vrf-blue up
 # Assign interface to VRF
ip link set eth0 master vrf-blue
 # Configure routes within VRF
ip route add 172.16.1.0/24 via 10.0.1.1 table 10
 # Enable VRF route leaking
ip route add 172.16.2.0/24 via 10.0.2.1 table 10





6. Static Routing Best Practices
Examples:
Network Summarization: ```
Supernet two /24 routes into a /23
ip route add 10.0.0.0/23 via 172.16.0.1 ```
Route Filtering with Prefix Lists: ```
Define prefix list
ip prefix-list ALLOWED permit 10.0.0.0/8 ip prefix-list ALLOWED deny any
Apply to static route
ip route add 172.16.0.0/16 via 10.0.0.1 prefix-list ALLOWED ```
7. Advanced Troubleshooting with BIRD
Example: Analyze routes using BIRD CLI.
# Install BIRD
sudo apt install bird
 # Enter BIRD CLI
birdc
 # Show routes
> show route
 # Show protocols
> show protocols
 # Analyze specific route
> show route for 172.16.1.0/24




8. Static Routing in Docker Networks
Example: Configure static route in Docker overlay network.
# Create overlay network
docker network create --subnet 10.0.1.0/24 my-overlay
 # Create containers
docker run --network my-overlay --ip 10.0.1.10 --name container1 -itd alpine
docker run --network my-overlay --ip 10.0.1.20 --name container2 -itd alpine
 # Configure static route on host
ip route add 10.0.2.0/24 via 172.17.0.1
 # Verify connectivity
docker exec container1 ping 10.0.2.109. Automating Static Routes with Ansible
Example playbook:
- hosts: routers
tasks:
- name: Configure static route
ansible.netcommon.cli_config:
config: |
ip route 172.16.0.0/16 10.0.0.1




10. Multi-Cloud Routing with Terraform
Example configuration:
# AWS VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "vpc" {
cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"

----- Advanced Route Manipulation----

Example: Modifying route metrics ```bash
Add a route with a specific metric
ip route add 172.16.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.1 metric 100
Change the metric of an existing route
ip route change 172.16.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.1 metric 200 ```



Example: Conditional routing based on packet marks ```bash
Mark packets with iptables
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp –dport 80 -j MARK –set-mark 1
Create routing table
echo “10 web” >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
Add route based on mark
ip rule add fwmark 1 table web ip route add default via 10.0.0.1 table web ```



2. Route Persistence and Fault Tolerance
Example: Using ip route save and ip route restore ```bash
Save current routes
ip route save > /etc/ip-routes
Restore routes on boot
echo “ip route restore < /etc/ip-routes” >> /etc/rc.local ```
Example: Implementing route health checks with a script ```bash
!/bin/bash
GATEWAY=“10.0.0.1” ROUTE=“172.16.0.0/24”
while true; do if ! ping -c1 -W1 $GATEWAY &> /dev/null; then ip route del $ROUTE via $GATEWAY ip route add $ROUTE via
$BACKUP_GATEWAY fi sleep 5 done ```




3. IPv6 Routing Table Management
Example: Configuring IPv6 static routes ```bash
Add an IPv6 static route
ip -6 route add 2001:db8:2::/64 via 2001:db8:1::1
Show IPv6 routing table
ip -6 route ``Example: IPv6 policy-based routing ```bash
Create routing tables
echo “10 v6default” >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
echo “20 v6priority” >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
Configure routes
ip -6 route add default via 2001:db8:1::1 table v6default ip -6 route add default via 2001:db8:1::2 table v6priority
Define rules
ip -6 rule add from 2001:db8:1::100 table v6priority ip -6 rule add table v6default ```




4. Route Optimization Techniques
Example: Route aggregation and summarization ```bash
Instead of multiple /24 routes
ip route add 172.16.1.0/24 via 10.0.0.1 ip route add 172.16.2.0/24 via 10.0.0.1 ip route add 172.16.3.0/24 via 10.0.0.1
Summarize with a single /22 route
ip route add 172.16.0.0/22 via 10.0.0.1
```
Example: Blackhole routing for unreachable destinations ```bash
Discard traffic to 10.0.0.0/24
ip route add blackhole 10.0.0.0/24 ```




5. Scripting and Automation
Example: Python script to manage routes ```python import subprocess
def add_route(network, gateway): subprocess.run([“ip”, “route”, “add”, network, “via”, gateway])
def del_route(network): subprocess.run([“ip”, “route”, “del”, network])
Add a route
add_route(“172.16.0.0/24”, “10.0.0.1”)
Delete a route
del_route(“172.16.0.0/24”) ```
Example: Ansible playbook for static route configuration ```yaml
hosts: routers tasks:
name: Add static route ansible.netcommon.cli_config: config: | ip route 172.16.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.1 ```




6. Troubleshooting Complex Scenarios
Example: Debugging route loops ```bash
Detect route loops
traceroute -n 172.16.0.100Output shows same hops repeatedly
Identify and fix misconfigured routes
ip route show ip route change 172.16.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.2 ```
Example: Resolving routing table inconsistencies ```bash
Check for inconsistencies
ip route list table all
Remove conflicting routes
ip route del 172.16.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.1 ip route flush cache ```
