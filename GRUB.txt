1. Introduction to GRUB

What is GRUB?

GRUB, or GRand Unified Bootloader, is a powerful and flexible bootloader used to load and manage operating systems on a computer. It supports a wide range of operating systems and provides a menu interface for selecting the desired OS to boot.
Importance of GRUB in Linux

GRUB is crucial for managing the boot process of Linux systems. It allows users to select from multiple installed operating systems, pass kernel parameters, and troubleshoot boot issues.





2. GRUB Architecture

Components of GRUB

GRUB consists of several components:

    Stage 1: The initial bootstrap code located in the Master Boot Record (MBR) or UEFI partition.
    Stage 1.5: Optional intermediate code that bridges Stage 1 and Stage 2.
    Stage 2: The main GRUB code that provides the menu interface and loads the kernel.

GRUB Configuration Files

The main configuration file for GRUB is grub.cfg, typically located in /boot/grub/. This file contains menu entries and boot parameters.



3. Basic Configuration of GRUB
Installing GRUB

To install GRUB, use the following commands based on your system type.

For BIOS systems:
sudo grub-install /dev/sda

For UEFI systems:
sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=grub



Understanding the grub.cfg File

The grub.cfg file contains menu entries and boot parameters. It is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig or update-grub.

Example grub.cfg Entry:
menuentry 'Ubuntu' {
    set root=(hd0,1)
    linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet splash
    initrd /initrd.img
}




Configuring GRUB Menu Entries

To customize GRUB menu entries, edit the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file.

Example Custom Entry:
menuentry 'Custom Kernel' {
    set root=(hd0,1)
    linux /vmlinuz-5.10.0-custom root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet splash
    initrd /initrd.img-5.10.0-custom
}

After making changes, update GRUB:
sudo update-grub




4. Common GRUB Commands and Their Usage

grub-install

Installs the GRUB bootloader to the specified device.

Example:
sudo grub-install /dev/sda



grub-mkconfig

Generates the grub.cfg file based on scripts in /etc/grub.d/ and settings in /etc/default/grub.

Example:
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

update-grub
sudo update-grub




5. Advanced GRUB Configurations

Configuring Multiple Operating Systems

To configure GRUB to boot multiple operating systems, add entries for each OS in the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file.

Example:
menuentry 'Windows 10' {
    set root='(hd0,2)'
    chainloader +1
}



Password Protecting GRUB

To password protect GRUB, generate a password hash using grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 and add it to /etc/grub.d/40_custom.

Generate Password Hash:
sudo grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2

Add to Configuration:
set superusers="root"
password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.<hash>






Customizing the GRUB Menu

To customize the appearance of the GRUB menu, edit the /etc/default/grub file.

Example:
# Set the default boot entry to the second entry
GRUB_DEFAULT=1

# Set the GRUB menu timeout to 5 seconds
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5

# Set a background image
GRUB_BACKGROUND=/boot/grub/background.png

# Disable recovery mode menu entries
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"

After making changes, update GRUB:
sudo update-grub





6. Practical Hands-on Scenarios
Example: Recovering a Lost GRUB Bootloader

If GRUB is lost, you can restore it using a live CD.

Steps:
    Boot from a live CD or USB.
    Open a terminal and mount the root filesystem.
    bash

sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt

Mount the necessary filesystems.
sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys



Chroot into the mounted filesystem.
sudo chroot /mnt

Reinstall GRUB.
grub-install /dev/sda
update-grub

Exit chroot and reboot.
    exit
    sudo reboot






Example: Adding a Custom Kernel Entry

To add a custom kernel entry, edit the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file.

Example:
menuentry 'Custom Kernel' {
    set root=(hd0,1)
    linux /vmlinuz-5.10.0-custom root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet splash
    initrd /initrd.img-5.10.0-custom
}

Update GRUB:
sudo update-grub




Example: Enabling Verbose Boot

To enable verbose boot, edit the /etc/default/grub file and remove quiet and splash from the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line.

Example:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""

Update GRUB:
sudo update-grub





7. Comprehensive Security Measures
Securing GRUB Configuration Files

Ensure that only root can modify GRUB configuration files.

Example:
sudo chown root:root /boot/grub/grub.cfg
sudo chmod 600 /boot/grub/grub.cfg




Implementing Password Protection

Password protect GRUB to prevent unauthorized access.

Example:

    Generate a password hash.
sudo grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2




Add the hash to /etc/grub.d/40_custom.
set superusers="root"
password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.<hash>







8. Performance Metrics and Optimization

Measuring Boot Performance

Use boot performance tools like systemd-analyze to measure boot time.

Example:
systemd-analyze


Optimizing GRUB Boot Time

To optimize boot time, reduce the GRUB menu timeout and disable unnecessary services.

Example:
# Set the GRUB menu timeout to 3 seconds
GRUB_TIMEOUT=3

# Update GRUB configuration
sudo update-grub





9. Advanced Network Booting with GRUB
Configuring GRUB for Network Boot

To configure GRUB for network boot, set up a TFTP server and configure GRUB to use it.

Example Configuration:
net_bootp
set root=(tftp,192.168.1.100)
chainloader +1
boot

Using GRUB with PXE Boot

To use GRUB with PXE boot, configure a PXE server and create a GRUB configuration file.

Example PXE Configuration:

    Set up a PXE server.
    Create a GRUB configuration file (grub.cfg) on the server.
    bash

    menuentry 'Network Boot' {
        set root=(pxe)
        linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=192.168.1.100:/nfsroot
        initrd /initrd.img
    }





10. Operational Resilience and Disaster Recovery
Backup and Restore GRUB Configurations

To ensure operational resilience, regularly back up your GRUB configuration files.

Example Backup:
sudo cp /boot/grub/grub.cfg /boot/grub/grub.cfg.bak

Example Restore:
sudo cp /boot/grub/grub.cfg.bak /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Disaster Recovery for GRUB

Prepare for disaster recovery by creating recovery media and documenting recovery procedures.

Example Recovery Media:

    Create a bootable USB drive with a live Linux distribution.
    Document the steps to restore GRUB using the live USB.





11. Documentation and Governance

GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is an essential part of the booting process of Unix-like systems. It was initially developed by Erich Boleyn as part of the GNU Project. Understanding its evolution helps appreciate its current capabilities and limitations.
Conceptual Depth

GRUB operates as a two-stage bootloader. The first stage, usually stored in the Master Boot Record (MBR), loads the second stage, which is responsible for loading the operating system.
Boot Process Internals

The boot process consists of several stages:

    BIOS/UEFI Initialization: The system firmware initializes hardware and passes control to the bootloader.
    GRUB Stage 1: Loaded from the MBR, it loads Stage 1.5 or Stage 2.
    GRUB Stage 1.5: Loaded from the first few sectors of the disk, it provides filesystem support.
    GRUB Stage 2: Loads the operating system kernel and initial RAM disk (initrd).








-Technical Depth-
Low-Level Technical Details

GRUB interacts closely with system firmware and hardware. Understanding these interactions is crucial for advanced configuration and troubleshooting.
Boot Stages


    Stage 1: Located in the MBR, it is limited to 512 bytes.
    Stage 1.5: Provides support for reading from various filesystems.
    Stage 2: The main GRUB code, located in the /boot directory, reads the configuration file and loads the OS kernel.





Firmware Interaction

GRUB needs to interact with BIOS or UEFI firmware to load the operating system. This involves reading from disk sectors, initializing hardware, and switching from real mode to protected mode.

Example: GRUB Configuration File (/boot/grub/grub.cfg)
plaintext

set default=0
set timeout=5

menuentry 'GNU/Linux' {
    set root=(hd0,1)
    linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 ro

**Objective:** Configure GRUB to dual-boot between GNU/Linux and Windows.

**Steps:**
1. Install GNU/Linux and Windows on separate partitions.
2. Install GRUB on the MBR.
3. Edit `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` to include entries for both operating systems.
4. Test the configuration by rebooting and selecting each OS.

**Expected Outcome:** You should be able to select and boot into either GNU/Linux or Windows from the GRUB menu.


























1.2 Explanation of Boot Process Internals
The Linux boot process involves several stages, each playing a crucial role in getting the operating system up and running. Here's a breakdown of the key stages:

BIOS/UEFI Initialization: The system firmware (BIOS or UEFI) initializes the hardware components and performs a Power-On Self-Test (POST). Once complete, it passes control to the bootloader, which in our case is GRUB.
GRUB Stage 1: This stage is located in the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the boot disk. Due to size constraints (512 bytes), Stage 1 has a very limited functionality. Its primary purpose is to load either Stage 1.5 or Stage 2 of GRUB.
GRUB Stage 1.5: This stage is optional and is used when the location of Stage 2 is not immediately known. Stage 1.5 provides filesystem support to locate and load Stage 2.
GRUB Stage 2: This is the core of GRUB. Loaded into memory by Stage 1 or Stage 1.5, Stage 2 initializes runtime services, reads the GRUB configuration file, loads the selected kernel into memory, and passes control to it. Stage 2 is where most of GRUB's functionalities are implemented.

1.3 Discussion of Low-Level Boot Mechanisms
At a low level, GRUB operates as a two-stage bootloader. The first stage (Stage 1) is loaded from the MBR and is responsible for loading the second stage. Due to its limited size, Stage 1 typically just loads Stage 1.5 or directly Stage 2.
Stage 1.5, if present, contains filesystem drivers that allow GRUB to access Stage 2 from the /boot partition. Stage 2, the core of GRUB, initializes the runtime services, reads the GRUB configuration file, loads the kernel, and passes control to it.
1.4 Detailed Architectural Insights
GRUB's architecture is modular and highly configurable. The core of GRUB (Stage 2) is designed as a set of dynamically loadable modules. Each module provides a specific functionality, such as filesystem support, command-line interface, menu interface, etc. This modular design allows GRUB to be extended easily and to support a wide variety of operating systems, filesystems, and hardware architectures.
One of the most important files in GRUB's architecture is the configuration file, typically located at /boot/grub/grub.cfg. This file contains boot menu entries, each specifying a kernel to load and the parameters to pass to it. Here's an example of what a simple grub.cfg file might look like:

set default=0
set timeout=5

menuentry 'GNU/Linux' {
    set root=(hd0,1)
    linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 ro
    initrd /initrd.img
}

menuentry 'Windows' {
    set root=(hd0,2)
    chainloader +1
}





In this example, GRUB is configured to boot GNU/Linux by default, with a fallback to Windows if no selection is made within 5 seconds. The 'GNU/Linux' entry specifies the partition where the kernel (vmlinuz) and initial ramdisk (initrd.img) are located, and passes some parameters to the kernel. The 'Windows' entry simply chainloads the Windows bootloader from the second partition of the first hard disk.

Technical Depth

With a foundational understanding of GRUB in place, we can now dive into the technical details. This section will provide an in-depth look at how GRUB interacts with system firmware, manages memory during the boot process, and loads the operating system kernel.
2.1 Firmware Interaction Explanations
GRUB interacts closely with the system firmware (BIOS or UEFI) to load the operating system. This interaction involves several low-level operations:

Reading Disk Sectors: GRUB needs to read the bootloader stages and the kernel from the disk. This involves using firmware services to access the disk at a sector level.
Initializing Hardware: GRUB is responsible for initializing certain hardware components required for booting, such as the keyboard, display, and sometimes the network interface.
Switching Modes: On BIOS systems, GRUB needs to switch the CPU from real mode to protected mode to access more memory and advanced features. On UEFI systems, GRUB already runs in protected mode.

2.2 Exploration of Boot Stages
As discussed earlier, GRUB's boot process is divided into multiple stages:

Stage 1: Located in the MBR, this stage is responsible for loading the next stage of GRUB. Due to its size limitation (512 bytes in the MBR), it typically just loads Stage 1.5 or Stage 2.
Stage 1.5: This stage provides basic filesystem support to locate and load Stage 2. It is located in the space between the MBR and the first partition.
Stage 2: This is the core of GRUB. It initializes runtime services, reads the GRUB configuration file, loads the selected kernel into memory, and passes control to it.

2.3 Memory Management During Boot
GRUB needs to manage memory carefully during the boot process. It needs to load the kernel and initial ramdisk into memory, while also providing space for its own runtime services. Key concepts in GRUB's memory management include:

Real Mode: This is the default mode when the system starts. In this mode, the CPU can only access 1MB of memory. GRUB starts in real mode but quickly switches to protected mode.
Protected Mode: This mode allows access to more memory and advanced CPU features. GRUB needs to be in protected mode to load the kernel into high memory.
Memory Map: The system firmware provides a memory map that tells GRUB which regions of memory are free to use. GRUB uses this information to load the kernel and initial ramdisk into appropriate locations in memory.

2.4 Kernel Loading Mechanism Insights
One of GRUB's main responsibilities is to load the operating system kernel into memory and pass control to it. This process involves several steps:

Loading Kernel Image: GRUB reads the kernel image from the disk into memory. The location of the kernel image is specified in the GRUB configuration file.
Initializing Initrd: If an initial ramdisk (initrd) is specified, GRUB loads it into memory as well. The initrd contains drivers and startup scripts needed for the early stages of the boot process.
Passing Control: After loading the kernel and initrd, GRUB passes control to the kernel. It also passes some information to the kernel, such as the memory map and the location of the initrd.

Here's an example of how a custom kernel can be loaded using GRUB:







menuentry 'Custom GNU/Linux' {
    set root=(hd0,1)
    linux /vmlinuz-custom root=/dev/sda1 ro
    initrd /initrd-custom.img
}
In this example, GRUB is instructed to load a custom kernel (vmlinuz-custom) and initial ramdisk (initrd-custom.img) from the first partition of the first hard disk. The 'root=/dev/sda1 ro' part specifies the location of the root filesystem for the kernel.

Security Considerations

Security is a critical aspect of any bootloader, and GRUB provides several features to secure the boot process. This section will cover threat modeling, secure boot mechanisms, and strategies for configuring GRUB securely.
3.1 Comprehensive Threat Modeling
Threat modeling is the process of identifying, quantifying, and addressing the security risks associated with a system. For GRUB, some of the potential threats include:

Unauthorized Access: An attacker may try to gain unauthorized access to the system by modifying GRUB's configuration or by exploiting a vulnerability in GRUB.
Tampering with Boot Files: An attacker may try to tamper with the kernel, initrd, or other boot files to execute malicious code during the boot process.
Exploiting Vulnerabilities: Like any software, GRUB may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain control over the system.

To mitigate these threats, it's important to implement a layered security approach that includes secure boot, password protection, and regular updates.
3.2 Advanced Secure Boot Mechanisms
Secure Boot is a feature provided by UEFI that ensures only signed and trusted binaries can be loaded during the boot process. When Secure Boot is enabled, GRUB needs to be signed with a trusted key to be allowed to load.
Here's an example of how to set up Secure Boot with GRUB:

Enable Secure Boot in your UEFI settings.
Install the signed versions of GRUB and the kernel:

sudo apt-get install shim-signed grub-efi-amd64-signed

Sign the kernel and initrd with a trusted key:
sudo sbsign --key /path/to/db.key --cert /path/to/db.crt vmlinuz
sudo sbsign --key /path/to/db.key --cert /path/to/db.crt initrd.img


sudo update-grub

With these steps, only signed versions of GRUB and the kernel will be allowed to load, preventing unauthorized modifications to the boot process.
3.3 Nuanced Security Configuration Strategies
In addition to Secure Boot, there are several other strategies for securing GRUB:

Password Protection: GRUB allows you to set a password to prevent unauthorized access to the GRUB menu. This can be done by adding the following lines to /etc/grub.d/40_custom:

set superusers="admin"
password_pbkdf2 admin grub.pbkdf2.sha512.<password_hash>

Replace <password_hash> with the hash of your password, which can be generated using the grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 command.
Encryption: If your Linux distribution supports it, you can encrypt your /boot partition to prevent tampering with the kernel and initrd.
Regular Updates: It's important to keep GRUB and the kernel up to date with the latest security patches. Most Linux distributions provide regular updates for GRUB and the kernel.


Performance Optimization

While GRUB is generally fast and efficient, there are several ways to optimize its performance. This section will cover techniques for benchmarking and optimizing GRUB's performance.
4.1 Performance Benchmarking Techniques
To optimize GRUB's performance, it's important to first measure its current performance. There are several tools and techniques for benchmarking GRUB:

systemd-analyze: This tool provided by systemd can be used to analyze the boot process, including the time spent in GRUB. Simply run 'systemd-analyze blame' to see a list of all running units, ordered by the time they took to initialize.
Kernel Parameters: The 'printk.time=1' kernel parameter can be added to the GRUB configuration to print timestamps in the kernel log. This can be used to see how long GRUB takes to load the kernel.
Hyperfine: This is a command-line benchmarking tool that can be used to measure the time taken by individual GRUB commands.

4.2 Resource Optimization Strategies
Based on the benchmarking results, there are several strategies for optimizing GRUB's performance:

Reducing Timeout: If you have multiple operating systems installed, GRUB will wait for a specified timeout before booting the default OS. Reducing this timeout can speed up the boot process. This can be done by setting the 'GRUB_TIMEOUT' variable in /etc/default/grub:




GRUB_TIMEOUT=2



Disabling Unused Features: If you don't use certain GRUB features, such as the splash screen or the recovery mode, disabling them can slightly improve boot time.
Optimizing Kernel Parameters: Certain kernel parameters can be tuned to improve boot performance. For example, 'quiet' and 'splash' can be removed to reduce the time spent on displaying splash screens.

4.3 Comparative Performance Benchmarks
It's also useful to compare the performance of different GRUB configurations. For example, you could compare the boot time with and without Secure Boot enabled, or with different timeout values. This can help you find the optimal configuration for your system.

Troubleshooting Guidance

Despite its reliability, GRUB can sometimes encounter issues that prevent the system from booting. This section will provide guidance on troubleshooting common GRUB issues.
5.1 Comprehensive Diagnostic Flowcharts
When faced with a GRUB issue, it's important to have a systematic troubleshooting approach. Here's a basic diagnostic flowchart for GRUB issues:

Check BIOS/UEFI settings:

Ensure the correct boot order is set.
Check if Secure Boot is enabled and if GRUB is signed.


Check GRUB configuration:

Verify that the GRUB configuration file (/boot/grub/grub.cfg) exists and is not corrupted.
Check if the default boot entry is set correctly.


Check for errors:

Look for any error messages displayed by GRUB.
Check the system logs (e.g., /var/log/syslog) for GRUB-related errors.


Attempt to boot from a live USB:

If you can boot from a live USB, the issue is likely with GRUB or the Linux installation.
If you can't boot from a live USB, the issue is likely with the hardware or BIOS/UEFI.


Reinstall GRUB:

If the issue appears to be with GRUB, try reinstalling it from a live USB.


Check filesystem integrity:

If reinstalling GRUB doesn't help, check the integrity of the filesystems, particularly /boot.


Seek further assistance:

If the issue persists, seek assistance from the Linux distribution's support channels or forums.



5.2 Error Log Interpretation
GRUB logs errors to the system log, which is typically located at /var/log/syslog. Here are some common GRUB error messages and their interpretations:

"error: no such device": This error indicates that GRUB cannot find the device or partition specified in its configuration. This could be due to a change in the disk layout or a corrupted GRUB configuration.
"error: no such partition": This error indicates that the specified partition does not exist. This could be due to a change in the partition layout or a corrupted partition table.
"error: file not found": This error indicates that GRUB cannot find the specified file (usually the kernel or initrd). This could be due to a missing or misnamed file, or a corrupted filesystem.

5.3 Advanced Recovery Techniques
If the basic troubleshooting steps don't resolve the issue, more advanced recovery techniques may be necessary:

Live USB: Booting from a live USB allows you to access the system's files and make repairs. Most Linux distributions provide live USBs for this purpose.
GRUB Rescue Mode: If GRUB is unable to find its configuration file, it will enter rescue mode. From here, you can manually specify the location of the GRUB configuration and attempt to boot the system.
Chroot: If you can boot from a live USB, you can use chroot to change the apparent root directory to your Linux installation. This allows you to run commands as if you were running from your installed system.



Here is the continuation of the comprehensive guide on GRUB, with the requested teaching style and approach applied:
Example: Recovering from a GRUB Boot Failure
Let's walk through an example of how you might recover from a GRUB boot failure using a live USB:

First, create a live USB of your Linux distribution and boot from it. This will give you access to your system's files without needing to boot from your installed system.
Once booted into the live USB, open a terminal and mount your Linux partition. For this example, let's assume your Linux partition is /dev/sda1:



sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt

Next, we need to mount some special filesystems required for a chroot environment:
sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys

These commands ensure that the devices, processes, and system files from the live USB are available in your chroot environment.
Now, we can change the apparent root directory to your installed system using chroot:
sudo chroot /mnt


After this command, any commands you run will affect your installed system, not the live USB.
From here, you can attempt to reinstall GRUB:
grub-install /dev/sda
update-grub

This will reinstall GRUB to the MBR of your first hard disk (/dev/sda) and update the GRUB configuration.
If the reinstallation was successful, exit the chroot environment and reboot:
exit
sudo reboot









Compliance Configuration Techniques

Ensuring GRUB configurations meet regulatory compliance requirements involves:

    Encryption: Encrypting disk partitions to protect data.
    Audit Logging: Maintaining logs of boot events for auditing purposes.

Example: Enabling Disk Encryption
bash

# Encrypt disk partition
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 encrypted_partition

# Update GRUB configuration to use encrypted partition
menuentry 'Encrypted GNU/Linux' {
    set root=(hd0,1)
    linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/mapper/encrypted_partition ro
    initrd /initrd.img
}

Threat Modeling Skills

Developing threat modeling skills involves identifying potential threats and implementing mitigations.

Example: Threat Model for GRUB
Markdown

**Threat Model for GRUB**

1. **Identify Assets**: Bootloader code, configuration files, kernel images.
2. **Identify Threats**: Unauthorized access, tampering with boot files, exploiting vulnerabilities.
3. **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Weak passwords, unencrypted configurations.
4. **Implement Mitigations**: Strong passwords, secure boot, encryption.

5. Troubleshooting Methodologies
Systematic Diagnostic Flowcharts

Creating diagnostic flowcharts helps in systematically identifying and resolving boot issues.

Example: Diagnostic Flowchart for GRUB Boot Issues
Markdown

**GRUB Boot Issue Diagnostic Flowchart**

1. **Check Boot Order**: Ensure the correct boot device is selected in BIOS/UEFI.
2. **Verify Configuration**: Check `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` for errors.
3. **Inspect Logs**: Review `/var/log/syslog` and `/var/log/boot.log` for error messages.
4. **Rescue Mode**: Boot into rescue mode using a live CD/USB.
5. **Reinstall GRUB**: Use `grub-install` to reinstall GRUB on the boot device.
6. **Test Boot**: Reboot and verify if the issue is resolved.

Error Log Interpretation

Understanding and interpreting error logs is crucial for effective troubleshooting.

Example: Recovering from a GRUB Boot Failure
bash

# Boot from a live CD/USB
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda
sudo update-grub

Advanced Recovery Techniques

Advanced recovery techniques involve using live CDs, rescue modes, and manual GRUB configurations to recover from boot failures.

Example: Using GRUB Rescue Mode
bash

# Boot into GRUB rescue mode
# Identify the boot partition
ls

# Set the root partition
set root=(hd0,1)

# Load and execute the normal module
insmod normal
normal
